## Loading the packages

Run the codeblock below to load the packages we will need for this recap

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)
```

## Load Data

Run the codeblock below to load the data.

```{r}
earthquakes <- read_csv('https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.csv')

#Setting time column as datetime
#earthquakes <- earthquakes |> mutate(time = as_datetime(time))
```

#### Answer the questions below

Most questions have a code block and a space for an answer below. Write the code you think is necessary and, in the answer space, write out what you did and what was the result.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q1** Do you notice anything different with this read_csv()? Particularly in the file name?

**A1: URL**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q2** How many records there are there in this dataset? What do they mean and what useful information we can gather from it, looking at the columns?

**A2: 9187**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q3** How do I reorganize this list to see the ones that are the deepest first? What is the depth that shows up for the deepest one, and its magnitude?

```{r}

earthquakes |>
  arrange(desc(depth))
```

**A3: The depth for the deepest earthquake is at 628.362 and its magnitude is at 4.60.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q4** I just want to see the earthquakes with a magnitude larger than 6. How do I do that? And how many are there that fit this criteria?

```{r}
earthquakes |>
  filter(mag > 6)

```

**A4: There are six earthquakes that fit the criteria of a magnitude larger than 6.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q5** What about if I want to see earthquakes that have both a magnitude larger than 6 and a depth smaller than 20? How many are there in the data set that fit [both]{.underline} these criteria?

```{r}
earthquakes |> 
  filter(mag > 6 & depth < 20)

```

**A5: There are four earthquakes that fit this criteria.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q6** What about if I want to see earthquakes that either have a magnitude larger than 6 and a depth smaller than 20? How many are there in the data set that fit [either]{.underline} these criteria?

```{r}
earthquakes |> 
  filter(mag > 6 | depth < 20)

```

**A6: 7,476**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q7** I'm interested in finding earthquakes that took place in Alaska. Which column should I look at? How do I use it to find all the earthquakes in Alaska? How many earthquakes took place there?

```{r}
earthquakes |>
  filter(str_detect(place,"Alaska"))

```

**A7:** We should look at the place column since it has a list of addresses in it. There have been 2,168 counted earthquakes in Alaska, in the last hour.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q8** I notice that there is a column called 'type', that seems to have different kinds of tremors. What is the best way to find what are all the possible types of tremors, and counting how many of each there are in this data set? What are the first two most common types of tremors in this data set?

```{r}
earthquakes |> 
  group_by(type) |>
  summarise(
       count_types = n()
  
  )
  

  

```

**A8:** The best way to find all the possible types of tremors would be to use the group by function and summaries to put it all together and specify it by type. The first two common earthquake and quarry blast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q9** How do I calculate the average depth of each type of tremor? What is the average depth of the earthquake type in this data set? Is there anything that seems unusual or surprising in this finding?

```{r}
earthquakes |>
  group_by(type) |>
 summarise(
   count_types = n(), 
   average_depth = mean(depth)
 

  ) 
  



```

**A9:**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q10** I'm interested, in the future, to see the hours in which earthquakes happen. How can I extract the hour from the time column? (skip)

```{r}

```

**A10:**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q11** I want to make a note of all the records in this data set that I consider serious. For my purposes, I'm thinking that all tremors that have a magnitude that is larger than 3 are serious. How do I automatically create a new column making that distinction?

```{r}
earthquakes <- earthquakes |>
  mutate(serious = case_when(
    mag > 3 ~ 'Serious',
    .default = 'Not Serious'
         
         ))
```

**A11:**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q12** I have no idea how earthquakes work and I'm interested in seeing if there is a particular time of day in which serious earthquakes happen. How can I see that condensed in a table with all the hours in a day and all the serious earthquakes in each hour? What is the hour with fewer serious earthquakes and the one with the most serious earthquakes? (skip)

```{r}

```

**A12**:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### EXTRA Q What other questions are you interested in and how would you ask them in R?

How many earthquakes happened in Washington?

There are 562 earthquakes that happened in Washiington?

```{r}
earthquakes |>
  filter(str_detect(place,"Washington"))
  

```

What are all the status types and how many of each are there in the dataset?

Automatic and Reviewed are the two status types. There are 2634 automatic and 6603 reviewed status types.

```{r}
earthquakes |>
  group_by(status) |>
  summarise(count_status_types = n())

```

How many earthquakes has a depth greater than 100?

There are 339 earthquakes with a depth over 100

```{r}
earthquakes |>
  filter(depth >100)

```

Create a column where if the status type is automatic put A if its reviewed put R

```{r}
earthquakes <-earthquakes |>
  mutate(status = case_when(
         (str_detect(status,"automatic") ~ "A",
         (str_detect(status,"reviewed") ~ "R"
           .default = NA
         )
```
